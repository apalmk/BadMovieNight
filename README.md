# BadMovieNight
In this project we made a recommendation system that suggests general consensus bad movies they might like to the users. For example "Santa with muscles" is a general consensus bad movie but if you liked some other movie like "Santa with muscles" you might also like this. We used item-item based collaborative filtering and Matrix Factorization methods, however we suspect that content based methods work better for our problem statement and we are working on developing a content based system. Please go through the python notebook to get a sense of how this project works.
